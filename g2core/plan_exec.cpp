/*******************************************************************************
 * mp_forward_plan() - plan commands and moves ahead of exec; call ramping for moves
 *
 **** WARNING ****
 * This function should NOT be called directly!
 * Instead call st_request_forward_plan(), which mediates access.
 *
 *  mp_forward_plan() performs just-in-time forward planning immediately before
 *  lines and commands are queued to the move execution runtime (exec).
 *  Unlike backward planning, buffers are only forward planned once.
 *
 *  mp_forward_plan() is called aggressively via st_request_forward_plan().
 *  It has a relatively low interrupt level to call its own.
 *  See also: Planner Overview notes in planner.h
 *
 *  It examines the currently running buffer and its adjacent buffers to:
 *
 *  - Stop the system from re-planning or planning something that's not prepped
 *  - Plan the next available ALINE (movement) block past the COMMAND blocks
 *  - Skip past/ or pre-plan COMMAND blocks while labeling them as PLANNED
 *
 *  Returns:
 *   - STAT_OK if exec should be called to kickstart (or continue) movement
 *   - STAT_NOOP to exit with no action taken (do not call exec)

/*
 * --- Forward Planning Processing and Cases ---
 *
 *  These cases describe all possible sequences of buffers in the planner queue starting
 *  with the currently executing (or about to execute) Run buffer, looking forward
 *  to more recently arrived buffers. In most cases only one or two buffers need to
 *  be examined, but contiguous groups of commands may need to be processed.
 *
 * 'Running' cases are where the run buffer state is RUNNING. Bootstrap handles all other cases.
 * 'Bootstrap' occurs during the startup phase where moves are collected before starting movement.
 *  Conditions that are impossible based on this definition are not listed in the tables below.
 *
 *  See planner.h / bufferState enum for shorthand used in the descriptions.
 *  All cases assume a mix of moves and commands, as noted in the shorthand.
 *  All cases assume 2 'blocks' - Run block & Plan block. Cases will need to be
 *  revisited and generalized if more blocks are used in the future (deeper
 *  forward planning).
 *
 *  'NOT_PREPPED' refers to any preliminary state below PREPPED, i.e. < PREPPED.
 * ' NOT_PREPPED' can be either a move or command, we don't care so it's not specified.
 *
 *  'COMMAND' or 'COMMAND(s)' refers to one command or a contiguous group of command buffers
 *  that may be in PREPPED or PLANNED states. Processing is always the same. Plan all
 *  PREPPED commands and skip past all PLANNED commands.
 *
 *  Note 1: For MOVEs use the exit velocity of the Run block (mr.r->exit_velocity) as the
 *  entry velocity of the next adjacent move.
 *
 *  Note 1a: In this special COMMAND case we trust mr.r->exit_velocity  because the
 *  backplanner has already handled this case for us.
 *
 *  Note 2: For COMMANDs use the entry velocity of the current runtime (mr.entry_velocity)
 *  as the entry velocity for the next adjacent move. mr.entry_velocity is almost always 0,
 *  but could be non-0 in a race condition.
 *  FYI: mr.entry_velocity is set at the end of the last running block in mp_exec_aline().

 *
 *  This routine is called from the (LO) interrupt level. The interrupt sequencing

 *   Note 1: Returning STAT_OK ends the move and frees the bf buffer.
 *           Returning STAT_OK at this point does NOT advance position meaning any

/* Synchronization of run BUFFER and run BLOCK
 *
 * Note first: mp_exec_aline() makes a huge assumption: When it comes time to get a
 *  new run block (mr.r) it assumes the planner block (mr.p) has been fully planned
 *  via the JIT forward planning and is ready for use as the new run block.
 *
 * The runtime uses 2 structures for the current move or commend, the run BUFFER
 *  from the planner queue (mb.r, aka bf), and the run BLOCK from the runtime
 *  singleton (mr.r). These structures are synchronized implicitly, but not
 *  explicitly referenced, as pointers can lead to race conditions.
 *  See plan_zoid.cpp / mp_calculate_ramps() for more details
 *
 * When mp_exec_aline() needs to grab a new planner buffer for a new move or command
 *  (i.e. block state is inactive) it swaps (rolls) the run and planner BLOCKS so that
 *  mr.p (planner block) is now the mr.r (run block), and the old mr.r block becomes
 *  available for planning; it becomes mr.p block.
 *
 * At the same time, it's when finished with its current run buffer (mb.r), it has already
 *  advanced to the next buffer. mp_exec_move() does this at the end of previous move.
 *  Or in the bootstrap case, there never was a previous mb.r, so the current one is OK.
 *
 * As if by magic, the new mb.r aligns with the run block that was just moved in from
 *  the planning block.

/*
 * Forward difference math explained:
 *
 *  We are using a quintic (fifth-degree) Bezier polynomial for the velocity curve.
 *  This gives us a "linear pop" velocity curve; with pop being the sixth derivative of position:
 *  velocity - 1st, acceleration - 2nd, jerk - 3rd, snap - 4th, crackle - 5th, pop - 6th
 *
 *  The Bezier curve takes the form:
 *
 *  V(t) = P_0 * B_0(t) + P_1 * B_1(t) + P_2 * B_2(t) + P_3 * B_3(t) + P_4 * B_4(t) + P_5 * B_5(t)
 *
 *  Where 0 <= t <= 1, and V(t) is the velocity. P_0 through P_5 are the control points, and B_0(t)
 *  through B_5(t) are the Bernstein basis as follows:
 *
 *        B_0(t) =   (1-t)^5        =   -t^5 +  5t^4 - 10t^3 + 10t^2 -  5t   +   1
 *        B_1(t) =  5(1-t)^4 * t    =   5t^5 - 20t^4 + 30t^3 - 20t^2 +  5t
 *        B_2(t) = 10(1-t)^3 * t^2  = -10t^5 + 30t^4 - 30t^3 + 10t^2
 *        B_3(t) = 10(1-t)^2 * t^3  =  10t^5 - 20t^4 + 10t^3
 *        B_4(t) =  5(1-t)   * t^4  =  -5t^5 +  5t^4
 *        B_5(t) =             t^5  =    t^5
 *                                      ^       ^       ^       ^       ^       ^
 *                                      |       |       |       |       |       |
 *                                      A       B       C       D       E       F
 *
 *
 *  We use forward-differencing to calculate each position through the curve.
 *    This requires a formula of the form:
 *
 *        V_f(t) = A*t^5 + B*t^4 + C*t^3 + D*t^2 + E*t + F
 *
 *  Looking at the above B_0(t) through B_5(t) expanded forms, if we take the coefficients of t^5
 *  through t of the Bezier form of V(t), we can determine that:
 *
 *        A =    -P_0 +  5*P_1 - 10*P_2 + 10*P_3 -  5*P_4 +  P_5
 *        B =   5*P_0 - 20*P_1 + 30*P_2 - 20*P_3 +  5*P_4
 *        C = -10*P_0 + 30*P_1 - 30*P_2 + 10*P_3
 *        D =  10*P_0 - 20*P_1 + 10*P_2
 *        E = - 5*P_0 +  5*P_1
 *        F =     P_0
 *
 *  Now, since we will (currently) *always* want the initial acceleration and jerk values to be 0,
 *  We set P_i = P_0 = P_1 = P_2 (initial velocity), and P_t = P_3 = P_4 = P_5 (target velocity),
 *  which, after simplification, resolves to:
 *
 *        A = - 6*P_i +  6*P_t
 *        B =  15*P_i - 15*P_t
 *        C = -10*P_i + 10*P_t
 *        D = 0
 *        E = 0
 *        F = P_i
 *
 *  Given an interval count of I to get from P_i to P_t, we get the parametric "step" size of h = 1/I.
 *  We need to calculate the initial value of forward differences (F_0 - F_5) such that the inital
 *  velocity V = P_i, then we iterate over the following I times:
 *
 *        V   += F_5
 *        F_5 += F_4
 *        F_4 += F_3
 *        F_3 += F_2
 *        F_2 += F_1
 *
 *  See http://www.drdobbs.com/forward-difference-calculation-of-bezier/184403417 for an example of
 *  how to calculate F_0 - F_5 for a cubic bezier curve. Since this is a quintic bezier curve, we
 *  need to extend the formulas somewhat. I'll not go into the long-winded step-by-step here,
 *  but it gives the resulting formulas:
 *
 *        a = A, b = B, c = C, d = D, e = E, f = F
 *        F_5(t+h)-F_5(t) = (5ah)t^4 + (10ah^2 + 4bh)t^3 + (10ah^3 + 6bh^2 + 3ch)t^2 +
 *            (5ah^4 + 4bh^3 + 3ch^2 + 2dh)t + ah^5 + bh^4 + ch^3 + dh^2 + eh
 *
 *        a = 5ah
 *        b = 10ah^2 + 4bh
 *        c = 10ah^3 + 6bh^2 + 3ch
 *        d = 5ah^4 + 4bh^3 + 3ch^2 + 2dh
 *
 *  (After substitution, simplification, and rearranging):
 *        F_4(t+h)-F_4(t) = (20ah^2)t^3 + (60ah^3 + 12bh^2)t^2 + (70ah^4 + 24bh^3 + 6ch^2)t +
 *            30ah^5 + 14bh^4 + 6ch^3 + 2dh^2

 *        b = (60ah^3 + 12bh^2)
 *        c = (70ah^4 + 24bh^3 + 6ch^2)
 *
 *  (After substitution, simplification, and rearranging):
 *        F_3(t+h)-F_3(t) = (60ah^3)t^2 + (180ah^4 + 24bh^3)t + 150ah^5 + 36bh^4 + 6ch^3
 *
 *  (You get the picture...)

 *        F_1(t+h)-F_1(t) = 120ah^5
 *
 *  Normally, we could then assign t = 0, use the A-F values from above, and get out initial F_* values.
 *  However, for the sake of "averaging" the velocity of each segment, we actually want to have the initial
 *  V be be at t = h/2 and iterate I-1 times. So, the resulting F_* values are (steps not shown):
 *
 *        F_5 = (121Ah^5)/16 + 5Bh^4 + (13Ch^3)/4 + 2Dh^2 + Eh
 *        F_4 = (165Ah^5)/2 + 29Bh^4 + 9Ch^3 + 2Dh^2
 *        F_3 = 255Ah^5 + 48Bh^4 + 6Ch^3
 *        F_2 = 300Ah^5 + 24Bh^4
 *        F_1 = 120Ah^5
 *
 *  Note that with our current control points, D and E are actually 0.
 *
 *  Further expansion, if we can do linear extroplation during a segment, we actually do want to start
 *  at t = 0.
 *
 *        F_5(h)-F_5(0) =    Ah^5 +   Bh^4 +  Ch^3 +  Dh^2 + Eh
 *        F_4(h)-F_4(0) =  30Ah^5 + 14Bh^4 + 6Ch^3 + 2Dh^2
 *        F_3(h)-F_3(0) = 150Ah^5 + 36Bh^4 + 6Ch^3
 *        F_2(h)-F_2(0) = 240Ah^5 + 24Bh^4
 *        F_1(h)-F_1(0) = 120Ah^5
