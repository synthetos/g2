 * mp_calculate_ramps() - calculate trapezoid-like ramp parameters for a block
 *
 *  This long-ish function sets section lengths and velocities based on the move length
 *  and velocities requested. It modifies the incoming bf buffer and returns accurate
 *  head, body and tail lengths, and accurate or reasonably approximate velocities.
 *  We care about length accuracy, less so for velocity (as long as jerk is not exceeded).
 *
 *  We need velocities to be set even for zero-length sections (nb: sections, not moves)
 *  so plan_exec can compute entry and exits for adjacent sections.
 *
 *  Note we use three data structures: mr, bf, and block.
 *
 *  bf holds the data from aline and back-planning. For the most part it is immuatable.
 *
 *  block is the data for forward-planning. There are only two block structures, and they
 *  are for the current block and the next block.
 *
 *  bf values treated as constants:
 *    All except block_time and hint
 *
 *  mr holds the current velocity, which is th entry_vlocity to the first block. The
 *  exit_vlocity of the first vlock is the entry of the next. To save having to figure
 *  out what block this is, we pass mp_calculate_ramps the entry_velocity is it to use.
 *
 *    All values of block are expected to be setup by mp_calculate_ramps.
 *
 *  Quick cheat-sheet on which is in bf and whcih is in block:
 *    bf:
 *      block_type
 *      hint
 *      {cruise,exit}_vmax
 *      block_time
 *      length
 *      (start values of {cruise,exit}_velocity)
 *
 *    block:
 *      {cruise,exit}_velocity (final)
 *      {head,body,tail}_length
 *      {head,body,tail}_time
