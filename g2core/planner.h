 * --- Planner Background ---
 *
 *  The planner is a complicated beast that takes a lot of things into account. 
 *  Planner documentation is scattered about and co-located with the functions
 *  that perform the actions. Key files are:
 *
 *  - planner.h     - This file has defines, structures and prototypes. What you would expect
 *  - planner.cpp   - Core and common functions, queue handling, JSON and command handlers
 *  - plan_line.cpp - Move planning and queuing, backward planning functions
 *  - plan_zoid.cpp - Move forward planning, velocity contour calculations and crazy math
 *  - plan_exec.cpp - Runtime execution functions, calls zoid's forward planning functions
 *  - stepper.cpp/h - Real-time step generation, segment loading, pulls from plan_exec
 *  - plan_arc.cpp/h- Arc calculation and runtime functions - layer above the rest of this
 *
 * --- Planner Overview ---
 *
 * At high level the planner's job is to reconstruct smooth motion from a set of linear 
 * approximations while observing and operating within the physical constraints of the 
 * machine and the physics of motion. Gcode - which consists of a series of into linear 
 * motion segments - is interpreted, queued to the planner, and joined together to produce 
 * continuous, synchronized motion. Non-motion commands such as pauses (dwells) and 
 * peripheral controls such as spindles can also be synchronized in the queue. Arcs are 
 * just a special case consisting of many linear moves. Arcs are not interpreted directly.
 *
 * The planner sits in the middle of three system layers: 
 *  - The Gcode interpreter and canonical machine (the 'model'), which feeds...
 *  - The planner - taking generic commands from the model and queuing them for...
 *  - The runtime layer - pulling from the planner and driving stepper motors or other devices
 * 
 * The planner queue is the heart of the planner. It's a circular list of ~48 complex structures
 * that carry the state of the system needs to execute a linear motion, run a pre-planned command,
 * like turning on a spindle, or executing an arbitrary JSON command such as an active comment.
 *
 * The queue can be viewed as a list of instructions that will execute in exact sequence.
 * Some instructions control motion and need to be joined to their forward and backwards 
 * neighbors so that position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk constraints are not 
 * violated when moving from one motion to the next. 
 *
 * Others are "commands" that are actually just function callbacks that happen to execute
 * at a particular point in time (synchronized with motion commands). Commands can control
 * anything you can reasonably program, such as digital IO, serial communications, or 
 * interpreted commands encoded in JSON.
 *
 * The buffers in the planner queue are treated as a 'closure' - with all state needed for
 * proper execution carried in the planner structure. This is important as it keeps
 * model state coherent in a heavily pipelined system. The local copy of the Gcode
 * model is carried in the gm structure that is part of each planner buffer.
 * See header notes in planner.cpp for more details.
 *
 * The planner is entered by calling one of:
 *  - mp_aline()         - plan and queue a move with acceleration management
 *  - mp_dwell()         - plan and queue a pause (dwell) to the planner queue
 *  - mp_queue_command() - queue a canned command
 *  - mp_json_command()  - queue a JSON command for run-time interpretation and execution (M100)  
 *  - mp_json_wait()     - queue a JSON wait for run-time interpretation and execution (M101)
 *  - 
 * In addition, cm_arc_feed() valaidates and sets up a arc paramewters and calls mp_aline() 
 * repeatedly to spool out the arc segments into the planner queue.
 *
 * All the above queueing commands other than mp_aline() are relatively trivial; they just
 * post callbacks into the next available planner buffer. Command functions are in 2 parts: 
 * the part that posts to the queue, and the callback that is executed when the command is 
 * finally reached in the queue - the _exec().
 *
 * All mp_aline() does is some preliminary math and then posts an initialized buffer to 
 * the planner queue. The rest of the move planning operations takes place in background;
 * via mp_planner_callback() called from the main loop, and as 'pulls' from the runtime 
 * stepper operations.
 *
 * Motion planning is separated into backward planning and forward planning stages. 
 * Backward planning is initiated by mp_planner_callback() which is called repeatedly 
 * from the main loop. Backwards planning is performed by mp_plan_block_list() and 
 * _plan_block(). It starts at the most recently arrived Gcode block. Backward 
 * planning can occur multiple times for a given buffer, as new moves arriving 
 * can make the motion profile more optimal.
 *
 * Backward planning uses velocity and jerk constraints to set maximum entry,
 * travel (cruise) and exit velocities for the moves in the queue. In addition, 
 * it observes the maximum cornering velocities that adjoining moves can sustain 
 * in a corner or a 'kink' to ensure that the jerk limit of any axis participating 
 * in the move is not violated. See mp_planner_callback() header comments for more detail.
 *
 * Forward planning is performed just-in-time and only once, right before the 
 * planner runtime needs the next buffer. Forward planning provides the final
 * contouring of the move. It is invoked by mp_forward_plan() and executed by 
 * mp_calculate_ramps() in plan_zoid.cpp.
 *
 * Planner timing operates at a few different levels:
 *
 *  - New lines of ASCII containing commands and moves arriving from the USB are 
 *    parsed and executed as the lowest priority background task from the main loop.
 *
 *  - Backward planning is invoked by a main loop callback, so it also executes as 
 *    a background task, albeit a higher priority one.
 *
 *  - Forward planning and the ultimate preparation of the move for the runtime runs 
 *    as an interrupt as a 'pull' from the planner queue that uses a series of 
 *    interrupts at progressively lower priorities to ensure that the next planner 
 *    buffer is ready before the runtime runs out of forward-planned moves and starves.
 *
 * Some other functions performed by the planner include:
 *
 *  - Velocity throttling to ensure that very short moves do not execute faster 
 *    than the serial interface can deliver them
 *
 *  - Feed hold and cycle start (resume) operations
 *
 *  - Feed rate override functions and replanning
 *
 * Some terms that are useful that we try to use consistently:
 *
 *  - buffer  - in this context a planner buffer holding a move or a command: mb._ or bf
 *  - block   - a data structure for planning or runtime control. See mp_calculate_ramps() comments
 *  - move    - a linear Gcode move, typically from a G0 or G1 code
 *  - command - a non-move executable in the planner
 *  - group   - a collection of moves or commands that are treated as a unit
 *  - line    - a line of ASCII gcode or arbitrary text
 *  - bootstrap - the startup period where the planner collects moves but does not yet execute them
